function [ind] = aic_pick(x,o)
%    P-PHASE ARRIVAL TIME PICKER BASED ON AKAIKE INFORMATION CRITERION
%
%    Computes P-phase arrival time in windowed digital single-component
%    acceleration or broadband velocity record without requiring threshold
%    settings. Returns P-phase arrival time index.
%
%    An abbreviated form of the Akaike Information Criterion is used
%    since we are interested in the global minimum. See paper by
%    Maeda, N. (1985). A method for reading and checking phase times in
%    autoprocessing system of seismic wave data, ZisinJishin 38, 365?379.
%
%   Syntax:
%          ind = aic_pick(x,'whole') consider whole seismogram to be picked.
%
%          ind = aic_pick(x,'to_peak') consider part of seismogram from 1
%          to peak value of x.
%
%   Input:
%          x = raw broadband velocity or acceleration data in
%              single-column format
%
%   Output:
%          ind = Index of pick in x; pick is the min(AIC(n)) + 1
%
%          AIC(n) = k*log(var(x[1,k])) + (n-k-1)*log(var(x[k+1,n])) where k
%          goes from 1 to length(x)
